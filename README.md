## Arch Linux Install

For new Arch installs run and chose the settings that best fit your use case.
I recommend using minimal for the profile.

WARNING: This script is intended to be run on new install systems.
Running it on a system that has been in use or configured could break your system.

Once the install is complete you should reboot into the new system as your user and run:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhjp-coder/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/install.sh)"
```
